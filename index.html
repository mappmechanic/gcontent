					<h3>Through the Continuum of Process, Analytics, Technology <span>Published October 21, 2013</span></h3>
					<p>
					Every enterprise is a collection of common processes strung together by technologies that help deal with massive and mutating amounts of data from an increasingly complex and interconnected world. The intelligent enterprise differentiates itself and outcompetes by turning common processes into smarter processes with superior analytics and class-leading technology and in turn, delivering superior business outcomes.</p>

					<p>
					<strong>Process</strong> - Companies structure themselves using functions and organizational policies; people and culture tune themselves to this functional view of the organization. Companies across all industries have a set of common, core enterprise-level processes that determine how they acquire new customers, retain them and grow existing relationships, hire and retain their workforce, develop and distribute their offerings and manage their supply chains. What differentiates the leaders from the laggards is how they view processes as a key component of business outcomes. For example, many organizations focus on driving process efficiencies - saving money within the process - and not effectiveness, which means setting enterprise-level strategies for processes to achieve desired business outcomes.
					</p>

					<p>
					<strong>Analytics</strong> - The emergence of big data, regulatory changes and social media developments are causing a big shift in the way businesses operate. Most companies know data is an asset and yet, even as a majority of this data sits within their organization, they have not been able to tap its true potential. How one company harnesses this data compared to others, makes all the difference. Intelligent enterprises innovate with data and employ analytics to identify trends and issues, uncover new insights, identify and prevent future risks and fine-tune operations to meet business goals.
					</p>

					<p>
					<strong>Technology</strong> - Technology has become a clear driver of flexibility and innovation in all business models. New technology and social connectivity are creating a deluge of opportunities, paving the way for cloud and other collaboration tools to transform internal operations, customer relationships and industry value chains. Intelligent enterprises must move quickly to seize the technology dividend. When applied intelligently – using insights from existing operations and emerging opportunities, with minimal capital expenditure along a variable cost model, and delivered in a scalable fashion using new mobile, SaaS and social media-based channels – technology can have an exponential impact on outcomes.

					<h3>Smart Enterprise Processes<span>Published May 20, 2013</span></h3>
					<p>Throughout our history, clients have told us that our ability to combine a bottom-up, granular, process-based approach, with Lean Six Sigma, is unique. Our Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP) framework is built on this approach and it drives our differentiation.</p>
					<p>
					Our Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP) methodology is a proprietary business process management framework. It helps organizations to consistently perform well in volatile environment and provides them the ability to anticipate change, dexterity to adapt to new conditions and spirit to innovate and produce new solutions. These organizations focus on process effectiveness as well as efficiency and operate smoothly across global markets. We call them Intelligent Enterprises.</p>
					<p>What is SEP<br><br>
					SEP is an uncompromisingly logical yet unique methodology that employs granular data analysis, ultra-sophisticated diagnostics and cross-functional benchmarks to maximize process effectiveness and achieve for example:<br>
					<ul style="font-size:25px">
						<li>Tighter controls resulting in stringent regulatory compliance</li>
						<li>Faster time to market, creating stronger revenues</li>
						<li>Improved capacity and productivity to better cost management</li>
						<li>SEP Delivers Value to Customers</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Impacting Business <span>Published May 14, 2013</span></h3>
					<p>As businesses grapple with rapidly changing economic conditions, globalization pressures, rising competition and shareholder expectations, optimizing business process is more important than ever. The SEPSM framework can make enterprises more competitive and intelligent by significantly improving their business outcomes such as cash flows, margins and revenue growth.</p>

					<p>
					With the SEPSM framework, a business is able to:<br><br>
					<ul style="font-size:25px">					
						<li>Have a holistic view across business silos providing an end - to - end process visibility to improve overall business results</li>
						<li>Compare its current process metrics with global industry and geographical benchmarks on a granular level identifying areas of improvement</li>
						<li>Focus on process effectiveness in addition to efficiency to deliver superior business results</li>
						<li>Link business outcomes at granular metrics across different business processes, thereby identifying value leakages</li>
						<li>Optimize business processes to get the most out of the technology investment</li>

					<h3>SEP Insights <span>Published May 3, 2013</span></h3>
					<p>In our experience a key reason for process under performance is the lack of performance measures, including industry benchmarks and best practices. SEP diagnoses value-oozing process gaps and makes relevant recommendations to plug these leakages.  It also unearths key business insights through sophisticated process data analysis and decades of process experience which then enable a business to compare its processes to industry benchmarks.These insights we provide to clients, along with our deep execution expertise including change management, can deliver differentiated outcomes for the Intelligent Enterprises to out-compete others.</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Some of the industry benchmarks are mentioned below:</strong>
					<br>
					<ul style="font-size:25px">
					<li>Claims<br>
					An insurance provider can release up to 50% of claim handler capacity & reduce overall settlement cycle time by 40% by enhancing claims segmentation and the adjudication process
					</li>
					<li>Customer Service <br>
					A 30% reduction in call volumes can be achieved through analytics of customer calling behavior, effective usage of IVR & improving first time resolution.
					</li>
					<li>Order to Cash <br>
					By cutting down on spoilage, pricing errors, fines and fuel surcharges by 50% - 75%, a $5 Billion CPG company can increase its annual earnings from $15-$20 Million.
					</li>
					<li>Commercial Lending <br>
					A commercial lending organization can eliminate about 1/3rd of early stage delinquencies through focused early stage collections and eliminate administrative delinquencies by reducing booking, billing and cash errors.
					</li>
					<li>Collections <br>
					For a typical $40-50 Billion in asset credit card issuer, analytics around agent measurement systems and customized training plans can impact losses by ~$100 Million.
					</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>CFO Report <span>Published April 17, 2013</span></h3>
					<p>Genpact partnered with CFO Research to conduct a ground-breaking benchmarking study on business process performance at large companies around the world. Covering 434 companies with revenue of $1 Billion or more, the report captures detailed benchmark data from senior finance executives on four fundamental business processes: Financial Planning, Source to Pay, Order to Cash and Financial Reporting including industry level comparison of performance.
 					</p>
 					<p>
					This study is a continuation of research that we have been conducting within the finance function over the last 3 years. Our 2010 study, also with CFO Research, focused on analyzing the CFOs role in standardizing global processes and improving business outcomes by making a shift from measuring process efficiency to effectiveness. A 2011 study with Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) explored how CFOs need to drive the transformation of delivery of financial services within their companies to create greater value and improve organizational performance.
